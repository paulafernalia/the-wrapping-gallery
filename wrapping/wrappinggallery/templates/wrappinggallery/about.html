        <p class="poppins-light fs16">My name is Paula and I have embarked on a mission to create a place for users of woven wraps where you can escape the temptation to buy new wraps and feel inspired to try new carries, make the most of your stash and find the perfect carry for any occasion.</p>

        <p class="poppins-light fs16">I want this resource to be accessible and unbiased. The Wrapping Gallery will never be affiliated with any brand. Access to all content in this site is and always will be free. If you choose to support the project, whether to help cover the costs of the server, data storage and the domain, or to acknowledge the time I dedicate to creating the content, any contributions will be welcome, but completely voluntary.</p>

        <p class="poppins-light fs16">This is an evolving project. There is a <a href="https://github.com/paulafernalia/the-wrapping-gallery/issues" target="_blank">roadmap</a> full of ideas to incorporate in future releases. If you have any feedback, suggestion, complaint, or spot any errors email me at <strong>thewrappinggallery@gmail.com</strong>. If you know who created this carry or the story behind its name, I would love to know! </p>

        <p class="poppins-light fs16">If you are tech-savvy and would like to contribute to the code, you can find my public repo <a href="https://github.com/paulafernalia/the-wrapping-gallery" target="_blank">here</a>, where you are more than welcome to create issues, contribute to the existing ones and create pull requests.</p>

        

        <p class="poppins-light fs16">May The Wrapping Gallery inspire and support you in your wrapping journey just as much as I am enjoying creating it.</p>
