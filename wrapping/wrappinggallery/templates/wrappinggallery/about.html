        <p class="poppins-light fs16">My name is Paula and I have embarked on a mission to create a hand-drawn tutorial for every documented woven wrap carry and a place free from the temptation to buy new wraps where I hope you will feel inspired to try new things, make the most of your stash and find the perfect carry for any occasion.</p>

        <p class="poppins-light fs16">May this platform inspire and support you in your wrapping journey just as much as I am enjoying creating it.</p>

        <p class="poppins-light fs16">This is an evolving project. If you have any ideas or spot any errors email me at <strong>thewrappinggallery@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
